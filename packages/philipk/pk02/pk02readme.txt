This set was meant to be larger but due to lack of time and a bit of
lost interest for this set I decided to release it as it is now.
Some stuff should have been tweaked more but as I said 
I won't and will just release it in it's current state instead.
I sure will try to release more sets in the future tho.

This set was created for Quake IV originally and was ported to Source.
If you want the Quake IV version goto: www.philipk.net.

Feel free to edit the textures and make additions in any way that suits you.
Have fun.
