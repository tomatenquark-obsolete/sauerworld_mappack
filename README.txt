What is a config folder and how do i find it?
---------------------------------------------

A config folder is a directory Sauerbraten looks up on start. In it you can setup new configs, maps, models, etc. 
The config folder mirrors your Sauerbraten folder, so the directory structure has to stay the same in order to have an effect on Sauerbraten. If you change files here, your original Sauerbraten will never be touched and so it's guranteed that even if you break it, you can delete the configs and you will still be able to play Sauerbraten! 


Finding the config folder in Windows:
-------------------------------------
Open the file explorer and type into the address field: $HOME\My Games\Sauerbraten
Alternatively, navigate to: My Documents -> My Games -> Sauerbraten


Finding the config folder in Linux:
-----------------------------------
It's ~/.sauerbraten by default.


Finding the config folder in OSX: 
---------------------------------
Open finder and navigate to this 
<hard disk>/Users/<your username>/library/application support/Sauerbraten/
(replace the <blabla> part with your credentials)


What isn't the config folder? 
-----------------------------

It's not: C:\Program Files\Sauerbraten\ 
It's not: C:\Program Files (x68)\Sauerbraten\ 
It's not: /usr/share/sauerbraten
It's not: <hard disk>/library/application support/Sauerbraten
